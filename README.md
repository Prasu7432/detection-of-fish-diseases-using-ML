# detection-of-fish-diseases-using-ML
This project proposes a machine learning solution using a Gradient Boosting algorithm to detect fish diseases. It assesses water quality and provides accurate predictions, helping farmers take preventive actions.Future work includes adding more diseases and using IoT for real-time, on-site application.
